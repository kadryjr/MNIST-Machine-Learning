# MNIST-Machine-Learning
MNIST digits dataset will be utilized. It is a dataset of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. MNIST has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It can be downloaded from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a classifier that finds the class of the test sample based on the distance of it from the training samples. It finds the K training samples with smallest distance to the test sample. The dominant class in the K points is then selected as the test point class. Project steps are as follows: a. Load MNIST dataset. (Phase 1) b. Apply HOG features to the images (sklearn) (Phase 2) c. Implement KNN with ‘K’ as a parameter and Euclidian distance. (Phase 3) d. There must be another 2 models to be implemented (of your choice)
